Debate
======

A social network based on debates over several topics in different fields. The social network is powered by a powerful room system that places users from all over the world to debate against or with each other on topics that matter to them. Everything you do on Debate is used to generate relevant statistics accessible to all users. 

This is a prototype to display the potential of user statistics and the display of KENDO UI at a basic level. During the presentation we have discussed the use of statistics to understand the user's position in any debate without relying on natural language processing.
